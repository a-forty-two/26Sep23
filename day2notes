DataProc-> native Apache Products
			-> VMs

Hadoop-compatible
		-> CHEAPER blob storage
		-> no editing capabilities 
		-> Google Cloud Storage

HBase-> managed HBase API-> BigTable

Hive-> managed HIVE style-> BigQuery

ETL-> apache beam-> DataFlow 
Original apache spark-> DataProc

Hadoop -> Petabyte scale
					-> mapReduce, real-time 
				-> DATA Lake

In-memory-> outside Hadoop
		-> In-MEM analytics
SPARK-> high in memory; no persistence of data

Kafka/Storm-> (building or consuming streams/messages)-> Pub/Sub -> create topics-> publisher can write/subription can read from topic 

Into the environment:
-> Batch
				-> SQL-> Hive
				-> NoSQL-> HBase
-> Stream
				-> building-> Kafka
				-> consuming-> Storm 

ETL -> Apache Beam
								-> Py and Java

Infra-> ZooKeeper nodes
